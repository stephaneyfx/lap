Application launcher for Linux

This scans for XDG desktop files and opens up a searchable list to launch the desired program.

Wayland is supported. X11 should work too, though this has not been tested.

# Usage
When the GUI has focus, the following controls are available:
- Enter: Launch selected app.
- Esc (twice): Exit launcher.
- Up: Select previous suggestion.
- Down: Select next suggestion.

# Configuration
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lap/settings.toml` is the configuration file. Available settings are described
below with example values.

```toml
# Font to use
# Default: None
font-family = "Source Sans 3"

# Whether the window should be resizable.
# Setting this to false may make the window float if using a tiling window manager.
# Default: false
resizable-window = false

# Name of the icon theme to use for app icons
# Default: None
icon-theme = "Papirus-Dark"
```
