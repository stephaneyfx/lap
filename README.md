Application launcher for Linux

This scans for XDG desktop files and opens up a searchable list to launch the desired program.

Wayland is supported. X11 should work too, though this has not been tested.

- `Enter`: Launch selected app.
- `Esc` (twice): Exit launcher.
- `Up`: Select previous suggestion.
- `Down`: Select next suggestion.

below with example values.
